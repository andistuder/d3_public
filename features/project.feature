Feature: Project
   pending "todo once view finalised"

#  In order to learn about the d3 software
#  I want to be able to view project made with d3
#
#  Background:
#    Given allow local http request
#
#  @javascript
#  Scenario: Creating and viewing features as an admin
#    Given I am logged in as "admin@d3.com"
#    And the following project categories:
#      | name  | slug  | content                                        |
#      | TV Projects   | tv-projects  | With d3 you can do TV projects  |
#    And the following projects:
#      | name            | slug            | content                                          |
#      | Take That Tour  | take-that-tour  | Sed placerat arcu et magna accumsan porta.       |
#      | Jay-Z           | jay-z           | Nec ante imperdiet rhoncus. Sed sed erat eros.   |
#    And I add those features to the CMS
#    When I go to the projects page
#    Then I should see "Stage"
#    And I should see "With d3 you can visualise in 3d"
#    And I click link "More"
#    And I should see "Visualise in 3d"
#    And I should see "Sed placerat arcu et magna accumsan porta. Sed vehicula purus in turpis mattis lacinia. Donec nisi nibh, tempor non eleifend"
#    And I should see "Live Input"
#    And I should see "Nec ante imperdiet rhoncus. Sed sed erat eros. Proin hendrerit ante ac enim placerat ut vestibulum mauris blandit. Etiam ullamcorper"
